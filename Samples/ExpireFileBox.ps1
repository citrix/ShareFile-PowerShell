# ExpireFileBox.ps1
#
# This script will list all files that are in any user's filebox and are 
# over 7 days old. By default the file box holds files for 30 days but 
# with this script you could identify and delete items earlier. Just uncomment
# the line that processes the delete once you have verified the files.
#
# Notes:
#   - The Outlook plug-in also uses file box to store files shared. Deleting
#     these files will expire the shared links.
#   - This script should be run as an administrator who has the ability to view 
#     other user's filebox
#   - 
#
