	# a) believe this script is configured and working properly (generating Symantec incidents for violations)
	# b) do not wish to scan uploaded files with an AV solution
	# c) wish to manually discard the current upload / AV queue items,
	# you could uncomment add this line (uncommented) at the end of the above for loop:
	# $Remove-SCQueueItem -qid $qid -id $qitem.id
	# However if AV is desired, then instead follow the instructions below:

 }
 # At this point, if all is configured correctly, all of the files in the
 # upload / AV queue have been processed and placed as email message files into the drop folder
 # so that Symantec DLP will have scanned them and created incidents if any violations
 # Else, if AV scanning is configured and desired
 # (see documentation on Anti-Virus scanning of StorageZones files
 # available here: http://support.citrix.com/proddocs/topic/sharefile-storagezones-31/sf-cfg-antivirus-scans.html)
 # then do NOT create a separate scheduled task for AV scanning--this script will serve as the one scheduled task.
 # --if you have the script at this point SFAntiVirus.exe tool.
 # This will cause the same items in the upload / AV queue to be processed, scanned,
 # and then discarded, ensuring no dupe incidents when this script is re-run
 # --to do that, uncomment the following lines:

 # cd  c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Citrix\StorageCenter\Tools\SFAntiVirus
 # C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Citrix\StorageCenter\Tools\SFAntiVirus\SFAntiVirus.exe
